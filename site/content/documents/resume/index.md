### What am I?

I am a *Software Engineer*. Just like that. I like to participate in sports in the weekends. I have 2 kids, with whom I like to investigate the forest when we have time.
I like games, and am always in for a match of *foosball*.

I tend to be allergic to bullshit, and like to give people autonomy in their work.

Also I love to cook and bake. I am not a chef, but it gives me zen.

### Profile

Passionate developer with a focus on operations, who loves new technologies.
But most of all I like tools to get the job done.
In my career I started as a tester. I always had an keen interest for programming
and automating processes.
I do not like to repeat myself, which drills down to scripting processes when I do it the second time.

Extensive background in full life-cycle of software development process, including design, development, quality cycle, release and maintenance. My motto is _You build it, you own it!_. I see myself as a code critic, on self-written code, but also code written by others.

Autodidact and _can-do_ mentality. This makes me a driver in teams. In the role as scrum master I believe in the team coming up with the best solution for the problem, instead of executing a plan thought of by someone else. Telling teams what to do, or strict hierarchical organizational structures will not get the best out of people.

I try to stay up with new technologies by reading about them and visiting conferences. Besides that I like contributing to open source projects, and developing in my spare time.
