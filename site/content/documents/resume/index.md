### What am I?

I am a *Software Engineer*. Just like that. I like to participate in sports in the weekends.
I have 2 kids, with whom I like to investigate the forest when we have time.
I like games, and am always in for a match of *foosball*.
I tend to be allergic to BS, and like to give people autonomy in their work.

Also I love to cook and bake. I am not a chef, but it gives me zen. But when I grow up I want to be baker in my own bakery. My corona-hobby is baking sourdough bread. I started with my own starter and want to bake at least one bread a week (so far I am holding up).

### Profile
------

Passionate developer with a focus on operations, who loves new technologies.
But most of all I like tools to get the job done.
In my career I started as a tester. I always had an keen interest for programming
and automating processes.
I do not like to repeat myself, which drills down to scripting processes when I do it the second time.

Extensive background in full life-cycle of software development process, including design, development, quality cycle, release and maintenance. My motto is _You build it, you own it!_. I see myself as a code critic, on self-written code, but also code written by others.

Autodidact and _can-do_ mentality. This makes me a driver in teams. In the role as scrum master I believe in the team coming up with the best solution for the problem, instead of executing a plan thought of by someone else. Telling teams what to do, or strict hierarchical organizational structures will not get the best out of people.

I try to stay up with new technologies by reading about them and visiting conferences. Besides that I like contributing to open source projects, and developing in my spare time.


### Experience
------

#### easee

**Scrum master** - *February 2020 - now*

As a Scrum master my main focus is supporting the development team.
Enabling the daily stand-ups and facilitating retrospectives are two of the main tasks.
I introduced working according to SCRUM and introduced the Sprints. Together with the
Product owner we started the weekly company demo's where the RnD team demos the work
that was accomplished during the week.


**Senior Software Engineer**  - *October 2017 - now*

At easee we create an online eye exam. Because our device has a measuring function we are classified
as a MDD 93/42/EEC medical device class I with measuring function (also known as class Im). Together with
the RnD we implemented ISO 13485 Quality Management System and got certified by TUV Rheinland.
Working in a regulated environment requires a different approach which can be challenging in its own way,
changes are stricter and more controlled than in other fields of the profession, but this will challenge a
different mindset.
My role, more specifically, has focus on the development and operations of the application.

The application itself is a php/laravel and VueJS/python application. The architecture is hosted on AWS.

### Skills
------

#### **Regulation**

Familiar with working in regulated environments (Medical device software) according to and with the
following standards:

* ISO 13485 - Medical Devices — Quality Management Systems
* ISO 14971 - Medical devices — Application of risk management to medical devices
* IEC 62366-1 - Medical Devices — Usability Engineering
* IEC 62304 - Medical Device Software — Software life cycle processes


#### **Programming**

I prefer using the language that will get the job done, over using it for the sake of using the language.
I like to peek around in new languages. My most recent interest is functional programming (Haskell).
During my studies at University I got in touch with C++. I still think it is one of the coolest programming languages around. But I am not afraid to write some pretty shell script to get a job done either.

> Why do something that takes 90 minutes if you can spent weeks on automating it.

A really nice quote, that might be applicable to me every now and then from a really cool blog post: http://tom7.org/lowercase/. Really worthwhile watching. It will cheer you up, trust me.

#### **Operations**

Very skilled with configuration management tools such as Ansible, Puppet and Chef Setting up (local)
environments using containerization with `docker`.

Skilled with AWS environments.

#### **CI/CD**

_(continuous integration/continuous delivery)_ Scripting and maintaining release scripts and pipelines. Very clear view and idea about continuous delivery and deployment. Very experienced in setting up pipelines with `docker` and `docker-compose` and high availability clusters using orchestration tools such as `kubernetes`

#### **Release management**

Very familiar with the processes to manage releases, using containerized pipelines, and orchestrating automated deployments.
Also, or especially, in regulated environments.
